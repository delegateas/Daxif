## Delegate Automated Xrm Installation Framework

A framework for automating installation of all kinds of xRM systems.
By using simple F# script commands/files one can save a lot of time
and effort during this process by using Delegate's DAXIF# library.

## Getting started

Check out [F# Setup](https://github.com/delegateas/Daxif/wiki/F%23-Setup) if you have not used F# before. This
will instruct you on how you can setup your computer for running these F# scripts.

Afterwards check out the example scripts in the sidebar to review what
Delegate's DAXIF# library can be used for, and how effective it can be!
